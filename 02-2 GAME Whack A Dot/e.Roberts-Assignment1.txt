Assignment 1 Analysis


	The first assignment proved to be relatively simple. I completed it over the course of about three days at about two steps at a time. I didn't have to add much code to the original project. For step four I only had to change RGB values for a rectangle. I had to force myself to follow the directions of the first extra credit. Instead of making a box class, I would have just made the dot class draw either a circle or square based off of a random number. I skipped the second extra credit because it gave me too much freedom. I tried to overdue it and didn't like the result I was getting, so I commented it out.
	Overall I didn't gain much satisfaction from the project. I would like the next one to be a bit more difficult. For a constructive example I would avoid steps that have students just modify values of already existing code. I did gain experience with FlashDevelop however. Before I worked with actionscript in adobe flash. To be truthful, the hardest part of the project was setting up the github. The interface for pushing and commiting files is really confusing. I'm writing this analysis while still trying to figure it out. If your reading this now, then that means I was successful. **fingers crossed**
