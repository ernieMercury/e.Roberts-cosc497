NOTE****
	Mouse Down Enabled
	
	Text turns purple when mouse down

	Turn back to black when mouse released




	This project proved to be harder than I thought. I was unable to do a number of the steps. The things I was able to do were simple. I used the mouse down event to change the text when the mouse was down and the mouse up event to change the text back. What threw me off is that is seems ad if mouse down only fires once. This made it difficult for me to seperate the initial press from the time that the button was being held. Double tap proved to be complicated as well. I tried some things but got no results.
